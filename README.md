###
[This is a 
link]https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/

Use pygeocoding when you need to build Google Maps and utilize the 
functions of the Geocoding API.

The intent is to provide a Pythonistic interface in building your Google 
Maps. As noted on the API page:
```
Note: the Geocoding API may only be used in conjunction with a Google 
map; geocoding results without displaying them on a map is prohibited. 
For complete details on allowed usage, consult the Maps API Terms of 
Service License Restrictions.
```
