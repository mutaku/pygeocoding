### Python API wrapper to interact with Google Geocoding for Maps API ###
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/

The intent is to provide a Pythonistic interface in building your Google 
Maps such as building a Google Map in Django with locations stored in your models.
As noted on the API page:

>Note: the Geocoding API **may only be used in conjunction with a Google map;** geocoding results without displaying them on a map is prohibited. For complete details on allowed usage, consult the Maps API Terms of Service License Restrictions.
